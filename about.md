# ðŸŽ“ Position

I have been a Professor at Mines Paris - PSL since 2019. Prior to this position, I served as a Lecturer at Cardiff University in the UK from 2009 to 2019.

# ðŸ§© Scientific Interests

My scientific interests focus on advanced simulation methods for predicting the behavior and fracture of engineering materials, such as composites and metallic alloys. Over the years, I have contributed to advancing the state of the art in model reduction to accelerate computationally intensive nonlinear finite element simulations, particularly through AI-based meta-modelling and adaptive multiscale techniques. I have also been involved in the development of non-standard finite element methods. A central theme of my research is the control of numerical errors, which I typically address through probabilistic approaches.
